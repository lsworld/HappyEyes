## Information

The digital era puts a major strain on eyes and our body. Many of us sit in front of screens the majority of a day and this lack of movement and constant focus on screens is harming us.

If you look at a screen for an extended period of time you may very well feel your eyes start to burn or feel dry. This condition, called digital eye strain, is very common and is due to your eyes blinking less and opening wider when in front of a screen. The 20-20-20 rule reminds you to look at an object 20 feet (6 m) away every 20 minutes for 20 seconds.
This rule, however, neglects the importance regular movement, as not only the eye is affected by our digital lifestyle. Around 36% of Americans report shoulder and neck pain, a number that is steadily increasing. 

Happy Eyes aims to help out by reminding you to take a break every so often – you get to choose if you wish for it to be every 20 minutes or hourly – as well as offering you activities that would help combat eye strain and improve your body’s health.
